# Experiment Log

## 2026-09-19 — initial implementation checkpoint

- Git state: two new, initially empty target repositories; CRANE
  `3fefd98904abc83842593be79be8eae133b3bb65`; astro_dock
  `36202373ae186a8fd247a20b7b477312a744de99`.
- Runtime: host Python 3.14; local Docker image `lunarzdev/astro:cuda`, image ID prefix
  `sha256:9c286b78dc`; ROS packages `nav2_msgs`/`nav2_bt_navigator` 1.3.12.
- Command: `python -m pytest -q`.
- Result: 14 passed; Dock/Slalom missing-policy, explicit-policy, recovery de-duplication,
  completeness qualification, outcome isolation, alternative status, final-clause rejection.
- Benchmark harness tests cover A/B shared generator/question, information-parity rejection,
  C extraction into checked reasoning, D no-resampling fallback, and deterministic E.
- Interface probe: inspected installed message/action definitions and `ros_topic_logger.hpp` in the
  container. Passive fields confirmed. This was not a live publication test.
- Data collected: 0 independent robot episodes; 0 benchmark responses; 0 exclusions.
- Model/provider/prompt: none; CPU-only deterministic test.
- Observation: existing CRANE fixture correctly labels odometry as delivered rather than proven
  internally consumed, but its `goalAttempts` is action-server startup/goal submission—not recovery.
- ROS package: isolated Jazzy container `colcon build` **TESTED**; writer test 1 passed. Live Nav2
  publication/capture and CRANE pilot remain **NOT_RUN**.
